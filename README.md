* [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)


## Built With

* [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database
* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) - Front-End Framework
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html) - ODM Library
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) - Back-End Framework

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
``

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

After confirming that you have an up to date git repository and a Heroku app created, complete the following:

1. Build the React app for production by running the following command:

```
yarn build
```

2. Add and commit all changes to git

3. Push to Heroku

If all previous steps were followed correctly, your application should be deployed to Heroku!
